    <h1> Assignment 1,  10-16-23 </h1>
    <a href="index.html"> Assignment 1 </a>
    <ul>
    <li>Some challneges I had was remembering all the tags to use and trying to 
        link my image but overall it was not too difficult.
    </li> 
    <li>
        I learned how to use git really effectively and I also learned some formatting things such as centering,
        but a lot of it was relearning things I hadn't used in a few years so it was a good referesher and intro assignment.
    </li>
    <li>
        I talked to class mates about how to upload and push evrything through git because I was having some file issues, but that was it mostly.
        What we learned in class was more than sufficient enough to make a webpage.
    </li>
</ul>
    <h1> Assignment 2, 10-30-23 </h1>
    <ul>
        <li> The whole assignment was quite challenging. I found it difficult to try to correctly format images. Also trying to measure and use flex boxes.
        </li> 
        <li>
            I learned how to better use css and improved my debugging skills when I found that something was wrong. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The most useful resources for me were my peers. I found very helpful to sit down and brain storm ideas with them when I was stuck. I did use stack overflow  when I had a error trying to run my code. I had to google more bout flex boxes and styling because I was confused on certain aspects of those elements.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Assignment 3, 11-12-23 </h1>
    <ul>
        <li> This assignment was decently difficult, definately harder than the last one. It was hard to remember all the things we learned and apply them but in the end it was do-able.
        </li> 
        <li>
            I learned how to better utilize javascript and greatly improved my debugging skills since I spend more time debugging than writing code. 
        </li>
        <li>
            The most useful resources for me were my google and stack overflow, as I said earlier debugging was very hard and some errors I just ran into a wall with and couldnt solve. I found very helpful to sit down and brain storm ideas with them when I was stuck. 
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h1> Assignment 4, 11-20-23 </h1>
    <ul>
        <li> This assignment was not as hard as the last two assignments in the sense that it was less css and coding and more googling and going over previous class notes.
        </li> 
        <li>
            To me the most challneging part about this assignment was everytime after a certain amount of refreshes my server would crash and I would have to reload and run vs code, and in the code iteself it was hard figuring out the error part and making it the html file.
        </li> 
        <li>
            The most useful resources for this assignment was definitely last weeks notes. We bascially covered everything in class more or less and that really helped when trying to finish this assingment.
        </li>
