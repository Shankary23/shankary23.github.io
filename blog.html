    <li>Some challneges I had was remembering all the tags to use and trying to 
        link my image but overall it was not too difficult.
    </li>

        I learned how to use git really effectively and I also learned some formatting things such as centering,
        but a lot of it was relearning things I hadn't used in a few years so it was a good referesher and intro assignment.
    </li>
    <li>
        I talked to class mates about how to upload and push evrything through git because I was having some file issues, but that was it mostly.
        What we learned in class was more than sufficient enough to make a webpage.
